Sequence to Phylogenetic Tree Generator

This Python-based tool consists of two scripts, "create_fasta_file.py" and "PhyloTree.py", designed to facilitate the generation of a phylogenetic tree from user-input sequences.

create_fasta_file.py:

This script allows users to specify the number of sequences they wish to include in the FASTA file. For each sequence, the user can enter a name, description, and the sequence itself. The script then creates a FASTA text file named "example.fasta" containing the entered sequences.

PhyloTree.py:

Using the Biopython library, this script reads the "example.fasta" file generated by "create_fasta_file.py" and generates a phylogenetic tree based on the sequences. The generated tree can be visualized to explore the evolutionary relationships between the sequences.

Key Features:

Easy creation of a custom FASTA file with user-specified sequences.
Generation of a phylogenetic tree from the created FASTA file.
Visualization of the phylogenetic tree for easy interpretation.
Usage:

Run "create_fasta_file.py" and follow the prompts to enter sequence details.
Run "PhyloTree.py" to generate and visualize the phylogenetic tree.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Biopython library

Get Started:

Clone the repository and run the scripts to create your custom FASTA file and explore the evolutionary relationships between your sequences!
